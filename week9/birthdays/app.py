#
# Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.

# GET, in a table, all of the people in your database along with their birthdays.

# query the birthdays.db database for all birthdays -> Pass all of that data to your index.html template.

# Render table -> Each row should have two columns: name, birthday
# When the / route is requested via POST, your web application should add a new birthday to your database and then re-render the index page. (Redirect)
# First, in index.html, add an HTML form. The form should let users type in a name, a birthday month, and a birthday day. Be sure the form submits to / (its “action”) with a method of post.

# Then, in app.py, add logic in your POST request handling to INSERT a new row into the birthdays table based on the data supplied by the user. (Using SQL)
# Optionally, you may also:

# Add the ability to delete and/or edit birthday entries.
# Add any additional features of your choosing!
