3.1/  Investigate phone number

As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say
that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the
phone to purchase the flight ticket.

If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
